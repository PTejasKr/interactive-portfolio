AUDIO-VISUAL SYSTEM PROMPTS

=== Audio Manager ===
Create Howler.js audio manager that:
- Preloads all sounds on initialization
- Provides play/stop/fade methods for each sound
- Implements global volume control (max 0.6)
- Respects system "reduced motion" preferences
- Supports crossfade between ambient tracks

=== Sound Mapping ===
Configure sound library:
UI SOUNDS (volume 0.2-0.3):
- hover.wav: soft blip on interactive elements
- click.wav: satisfying pop on clicks
- transition.wav: whoosh on section changes

MASCOT SOUNDS (volume 0.3-0.5):
- giggle-soft.wav: gentle laugh on belly hover
- giggle-big.wav: hearty laugh on belly click
- idle-breath.wav: ambient breathing loop
- sleepy.wav: yawn sound for sleep state

AMBIENT (volume 0.1-0.2):
- background-loop.mp3: subtle ambient music

=== Visual Sync ===
Implement Web Audio API analyzer:
- FFT size 256 for performance
- Extract bass, mid, high frequency ranges
- Beat detection with 0.7 threshold
- Smooth frequency data with 0.8 time constant
- Broadcast updates at 60fps to subscribers

=== Particle Reactivity ===
Connect particles to audio:
- Bass hits increase particle size (1.5x)
- Mid frequencies affect particle speed
- High frequencies control opacity
- Beat detection triggers particle burst
- Smooth interpolation between states
