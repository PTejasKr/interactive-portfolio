GITHUB INTEGRATION PROMPTS

=== API Fetching ===
Generate GitHub API client that:
- Fetches user profile and repositories
- Uses REST API v3 with optional auth token
- Implements response caching (24 hour TTL)
- Handles rate limiting gracefully
- Falls back to cached/mock data on error

=== Project Cards ===
Create project card component:
- Display: name, description, language, stars, forks
- Language color indicator matching GitHub colors
- Topic tags as rounded pills
- Tilt effect on hover (3D perspective)
- Links to repo and live demo

=== Filtering System ===
Implement project filtering:
- Categories: All, Frontend, Backend, Full Stack
- Determine category from language + topics
- Smooth GSAP transitions when filtering
- Active filter state management

=== Caching Strategy ===
Design caching system:
- Store in localStorage with timestamp
- Validate cache age on load (24 hours)
- Background refresh when stale
- Sync with Supabase for persistence
- Clear cache on user request
