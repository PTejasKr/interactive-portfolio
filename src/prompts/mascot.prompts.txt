MASCOT COMPONENT PROMPTS

=== Eye Tracking ===
Generate smooth eye tracking logic that:
- Follows cursor position using vector math
- Has limited rotation angles (max 15 degrees)
- Uses smooth interpolation (lerp) for movement
- Includes random blink animation every 3-6 seconds
- Widens eyes on hover, squints on suspicion

=== Belly Interaction ===
Generate belly hover and click effects:
- Hover: gentle giggle sound, soft belly bounce (scale 1.1)
- Click: bigger laugh, wave animation, aqua particle burst
- Ripple shader effect emanating from touch point

=== Emotional States ===
Implement state machine for mascot emotions:
- IDLE: slow breathing, soft ambient hum
- CURIOUS: eyes widen, higher pitch blip, lean forward
- HAPPY: giggle loop, bounce animation, sparkles
- EXCITED: rapid bounce, brighter glow, chime sound
- SLEEPY: droopy eyes, slow breathing, gradual fade

=== Speech System ===
Create tooltip-based speech system:
- Bubble appears above mascot head
- Typewriter effect for text reveal (30ms per char)
- Audio blip accompanies each character
- Auto-dismiss after 4 seconds or on click
- Queue system for multiple messages

=== Fur Effect ===
Generate fluffy fur particle system:
- 500+ small white particles around body sphere
- Particles sway gently with idle animation
- React to cursor proximity (repulsion)
- Scale slightly with audio amplitude
- Soft gaussian blur for fluffiness
